# ResMake

ResMake is a mobile application that generates a professional resume using a predefined LaTeX template.

-  Allows users to input personal, educational, and professional details through a structured form-based UI
-  Dynamically maps user input to LaTeX code using Room database for persistent storage
-  Streamlines resume creation for users with no LaTeX experience, offering live preview, editable data, and seamless export to Overleaf for final formatting
